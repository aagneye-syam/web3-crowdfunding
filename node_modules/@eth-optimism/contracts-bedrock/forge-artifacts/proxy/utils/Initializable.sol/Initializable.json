Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused.
